# Adding in the thing to collect emails

1. Needs technical design - perhaps a lamda that writes to a DDB table or can do something simpler with mailchimp?

## low priority
- navigation
- [UX Design] make the icon an SVG for crispness and re-use (ChatGPT did a poor job and was too much work to create)

# Dev happiness

- add husky (for git hooks)
- do formatting check (and actual formatting?) on pre commit
