## low priority
- navigation
- custom 404 page (TODO: test whether cloudfront just shows the homepage and if that will work, might need a redirection...)
- [UX Design] make the icon an SVG for crispness and re-use (ChatGPT did a poor job and was too much work to create)

# Dev happiness

- add husky (for git hooks for formatting)
- do formatting check (and actual formatting?) on pre commit
- (after rounds of feedback on design): generalize the hero sections and other parts into components so the code isn't such a mess
