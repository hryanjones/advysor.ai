# Basic Website

- ✅ ~~Apply theming~~
  - ~~colors~~
  - ~~fonts~~
- ✅ ~~Extract the SVG of the logo and use it in favicon and header~~ (pivoted to PNG)
- ✅ ~~Add icons: https://lineicons.com/icons?q=target seems good~~ (used react-icons instead)
- ✅ ~~Proof read~~
- ✅ ~~Redesign sections to be neater than just rounded boxes~~ (only change here was the first hero sections)
- Serving assets from AWS:
  - ~~S3 bucket~~
  - ~~cloudfront + SSL certificate~~
  - Route53 DNS control
  - deployment of assets

# Adding in the thing to collect emails

1. Needs technical design - explore the simplest options to achieve collecting. Could be mailchimp or dumping in a google sheet or something similarly simple.

## low priority
- navigation
- custom 404 page (TODO: test whether cloudfront just shows the homepage and if that will work, might need a redirection...)
- [UX Design] make the icon an SVG for crispness and re-use (ChatGPT did a poor job and was too much work to create)

# Dev happiness

- add husky (for git hooks for formatting)
- do formatting check (and actual formatting?) on pre commit
- (after rounds of feedback on design): generalize the hero sections and other parts into components so the code isn't such a mess
